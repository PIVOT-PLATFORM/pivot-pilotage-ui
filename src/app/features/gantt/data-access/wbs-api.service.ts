/**
 * HTTP client for the WBS contract (US22.4.1a/b/c) exposed by `pivot-pilotage-core`'s
 * `WbsTaskController`. Authoritative contract: that controller's own JavaDoc plus the backlog
 * files under `pivot-docs/docs/backlog/EPIC-roadmap/FEATURES/gantt-detaille/`.
 *
 * `tenantId`/`teamId`/`projectId` travel as **path segments** (never body/query/header) — see
 * {@link GanttProjectRef}'s TSDoc. This service never invents or caches an id of its own: every
 * method takes a fully-resolved `GanttProjectRef` supplied by the caller.
 *
 * **No error handling here** — every method propagates the raw `HttpErrorResponse` to the caller
 * (bodyless 403/404, 409 `{code: 'WBS_HIERARCHY_CYCLE', message}` for a hierarchy cycle, 422
 * `{code: 'ILLEGAL_WBS_MOVE', message}` for an inapplicable indent/outdent) — same
 * "propagate, don't swallow" philosophy already established by `RoadmapApiService`.
 *
 * **Known platform gap** — every write endpoint (`indent`, `outdent`, `move`) currently 403s
 * unconditionally server-side: `WbsEditPolicy` is wired fail-closed (`DenyAllWbsEditPolicy`)
 * pending `pivot-core-starter`'s project/team membership resolution (same posture as
 * `RoadmapApiService`'s `DenyAllRoadmapEditPolicy`). This service and its caller
 * (`WbsTreeComponent`) are fully functional and tested against the *intended* contract; only the
 * backend's role gate itself is temporarily always-deny.
